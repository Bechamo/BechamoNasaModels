The Modular Air Vehicle Research Intelligence Kit (MAVRIK) is an unmanned aerial system that can be easily customized for various applications. 
The MAVRIK is designed using Advanced Aircraft Analysis (AAA) and can act as a test bed for new technologies. 
Thorough analysis was performed to ensure that the propellers, major aircraft members, and avionics mounting points are structurally sound. 
The aircraft is 90% composite with 3D-printed, wood, and aluminum components. 
DARcorporation developed a Hover Test Bed (HTB) vehicle to validate the hover characteristics of the MAVRIK Distribution Electric Propulsion (DEP) layout. 
Testing of the HTB confirmed the control scheme and allowed DARcorporation to fine tune the flight controller [1].

This folder contains files for the compressed and expanded simulink models that generate the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the MAVRIK. 
These aerodynamic model is contained in the exported output from ControlStar, in the aero_export.mat file.

Forces and moments are summed up from aerodynamic base and delta tables within the Library.
