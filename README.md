# BechamoNasaModels
Open models created for NASA by Bechamo and shared with everyone

BechamoNasaModels contains an open-source model for DARCoproration's subscale tilt-wing aircraft that runs within Simulink, created using Bechamo's aerodynamic data generation tools (ControlStar).

This open model provides an example use of data generated from ControlStar within a simulation model.
The model is modifiable, sharable, and provides a benchmark model to be used for controls research.

Use of this model follows the attached GPL v2 license agreement.  Use it as you wish, if you modify, find bugs, or improve it, please push back changes to this repo. 

The model (currently only the DARCorp Mavrik Tiltwing) is provided in a Simulink Library.
